- Control of multiple servo motors
- Joystick-based manual control
- PWM signal generation using STM32 timers
- Embedded C programming with STM32CubeIDE

## Hardware Used
- STM32F303RE
- Servo motors
- Joystick modules
- External power supply

## What I Learned
- PWM configuration on STM32
- Timer and GPIO usage
- Embedded systems debugging
- Hardware-software integration
